Welcome to the project that will change the future for autistic children and their families. Nowadays, it seems society is moving towards a better coexistence among all, which means creating for helping. Autism is one of the main issues scientists are focused on to help them develop social and communication skills to get an independent life in the future. There are doctors, phycologists and engineers working together. Actually, it is clear that each time more children can get to carry an independent life in the future due to the help provided since childhood, from both family and scientists. It is presented a development of a full body interaction video game for autistic children based on a Kinect based tracking system. 

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by lack of social skills, verbal and non verbal communication and restrictive and repetitive behaviors. It is rally relevant to help them from the childhood, for that fact the study was implemented for certain children; earlier age, fluenty speaking and high functioning autism. Moreover, they might feel comfortable during their participance for avoiding to isolate themselves. 

It is really very important to be able to carry out the whole project. There will be used two projectors, two sensors called Kinect and a big round playground area. In this work there are also several codes implemented; one is for the movements detected while playing the videogame, this one is for the implementation of the interaction analysis and the last one is the Manual of OSC Connection. Therefore, It has decided to consider this one the most relevant because the aim of the project is to capture the interaction of the children with the game. Even so, all of them are essential for the correct implementation. 

Every good project finds limitations during implementation. There isn'st mentioned any problems found during performance but he wish to carry out further the project to help autistic children develop their social and communication skills. Moreover, an alternative for more little classrooms is also added. For that it will be necessary more trials to ensure its effectiveness for a long-term application. 

For you to overview about the aim of the project and the methodology for its perfomance, here it is provided a summary of the main 4 parts.
